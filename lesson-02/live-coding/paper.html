<h2>Abstract</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  The rapid spread of the <strong>coronavirus</strong> disease 2019 (COVID-19),
  caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus
  (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the
  <em>biological features</em> of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs
  to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make
  therapeutic decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Based on recently published literatures,
  <strong>official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies</strong>,
  we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations,
  pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
